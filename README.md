Microsoft To-Do App Clone , made in C# and XAML, with the help of Avalonia UI framework : https://avaloniaui.net/

Not finished, due to some Avalonia bugs. The framework is still young and needs time, but unfortunately, that's not under my control, and the bugs were getting too big to manage. Awesome framework
though, and I'm looking forward to work with it again. The app, unfortunately, cannot be run by you, since the database I used for it was local. But if you want to look through the code, I should
mention the things I used : 
                   - PostgreSql local database
                   - C#, XAML, .NET 8.0, Avalonia UI
                   - EF Core for database overall handling 
                   - MVVM design pattern
                   - Repository & Services were exclusively responsible for data handling
                   - Some interesting REGEX code for string-fields verification
                   - lots of asynchronous programming so the UI wouldn't freeze whenever the database was called

I'm also very satisfied with the visuals I managed to build, since I was never that good at front-end:

Onto the next project!
